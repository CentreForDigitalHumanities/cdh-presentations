# Easy online presentations for CDH guild
This is a repository to host a bunch of online presentations for Centre for Digital Humanities.

## How to get a presentation website up and running
Basic HTML and GIT knowledge is required.

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new directory under `slides` with the name of your presentation. No gaps please, check the other names.
3. Copy the contents of the `slides/template` or other presentations that you like.
4. Style it with HTML/CSS/JS. This can be tricky so trial and error is adviced. Any time you want to view the changes refresh the `index.html` locally in the browser.
5. When you want to see it running as an online website commit and push. A pipeline runs. Voil√†!
